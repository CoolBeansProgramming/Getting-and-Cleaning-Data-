# Getting and Cleaning Data Project 
The purpose of this project is to collect, clean, and prepare a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis. The data with descriptions can be found on the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones" target="_blank">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.

# Analysis

0) Download the data in the .zip file 
1) Merge the training and the test sets
2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Label the data set with descriptive variable names 
5) Using the data in step 4, create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject
